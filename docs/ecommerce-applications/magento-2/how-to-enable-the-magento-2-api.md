# How to Enable the Magento 2 API

To enable the Magento API, first [**create the correct users**](https://www.yireo.com/tutorials/magebridge/administration/596-step-by-step-create-a-magento-api-user).

The Magento API is supposed to work out-of-the box on Hypernodes, but due to clean-url-rewrites sometimes the API does not work and returns a 404 error.
To resolve this issue, some additional configuration is required.

Use the following snippet and save it as `/data/web/nginx/server.api` to configure Nginx for routing all API requests to api.php:

```nginx
location /api {
    allow 1.2.3.4;
    allow 2.3.4.5;
    deny all;

    rewrite ^/api/rest /api.php?type=rest last;
    rewrite ^/api/v2_soap /api.php?type=v2_soap last;
    rewrite ^/api/soap /api.php?type=soap last;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        echo_exec @phpfpm;
    }
}
```

NB: If you donâ€™t want to update IP addresses in all config files with every change of IP address, you can choose to use [**include files**](https://support.hypernode.com/knowledgebase/create-reusable-config-for-custom-snippets/).
