# How to Set Up Your DNS for Outgoing Email

If your domain is hosted externally and you want to send email from your Hypernode, there are some DNS records that need to be added to the external DNS.

In order to stop spam, and ensure reliable delivery of your webshopâ€™s emails, you must first authenticate your domain, and set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, DNS records.


Adding DNS Records
------------------

Please add the following DNS records to your nameservers, to authenticate your domain. If you already have an SPF record (the fourth record in the table) in place please check out our documentation on [SPF](https://support.hypernode.com/en/hypernode/dns/how-to-set-up-your-spf-records-for-hypernode), or contact our support for assistance on how to merge the SPF content into your existing values.

Validating your DNS records
---------------------------

To check if your DNS records have been configured correctly, please check our online [DNS validator.](https://my.hypernode.com/dns/check/)

* The first record is the mail auth record required by the TransIP mailplatform, used at Hypernode.
* The second and third records are needed for automatic DKIM signing and DMARC
* The fourth record is the SPF record. Please make sure you include spf.***example***.hypernode.io in your DNS's SPF record.

Please check our [DNS validato](https://my.hypernode.com/dns/check/)r to confirm email can be sent successfully.
