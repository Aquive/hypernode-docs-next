### Outstanding Invoices When Cancelling Your Plan

Outstanding invoices must be paid. Unfortunately, Hypernode cannot make exceptions to this rule. Customers can cancel or downgrade the contract immediately after payment of the invoice.

### How Does Hypernode Cancel My Domain Name

You never want to accidentally delete a domain name. Because this causes many problems, Hypernode will cancel your domain name in small steps. If you change your mind, we can easily undo it. Below we describe these steps.

#### Cancelling Foreign Domains

If you cancel a foreign domain name, Hypernode will let it expire automatically after the contract date has expired. It is therefore possible that your domain name is still available for some time after you have canceled the domain. After the domain expires, your domain may go into quarantine. In this status, only you can register the domain name again, and usually only via Hypernode. Only after the quarantine period has expired is your domain name completely free and can it be registered by everyone.
