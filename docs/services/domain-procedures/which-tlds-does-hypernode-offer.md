## How to order a new domain

You can order a new domain very easy via your Control Panel. Please follow the steps in [this article](how-to-use-domains-in-the-control-panel.md#registering-a-new-domain) on how to order your domains in the Control Panel. Or click [this link](https://my.hypernode.com/domain/) to go to the Control Panel directly. 

## How to transfer you domain to Hypernode
You can start the transfer of your domain in your Control Panel. Instructions on how to do this can be found in [this article]()

Every TLD has it's own procedure when it transfers from one provider to another. For example, a .com TLD has a 60 day freeze after the registration. 
You can read more information about the transfer procedure for a specific TLD on [this page](extension-specific-info-per-domain.md).
