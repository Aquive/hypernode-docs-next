# Managing Your Teams

With teams you can invite other users to manage your Hypernode and it gives you much finer-grained control over who has access to your Hypernode.


Creating a Team
---------------

To create a new team:

1. Log into the [Control Panel](https://my.hypernode.com).
2. From sidebar on the left, click **Teams**.
3. Click **Create a new Team**.
4. Give the team a name.
5. Optional: select one or more available Hypernodes that should be handled by your new team. You can also add Hypernodes to your team afterwards.
6. Click **Create team**.

You will now see the team detail page from which you can invite new members and change the team name. By clicking on Hypernodes on the left you can see which Hypernodes are in this team.

Deleting a Team
---------------

Please note you can only delete a team if you're the creator of the team.

1. From sidebar on the left, click **Teams**.
2. Click on the **trash can** behind the team you want to delete.
3. Confirm the deletion on the next page.

Adding Hypernodes to a Team
---------------------------

There are two ways to add a Hypernode to a team:
