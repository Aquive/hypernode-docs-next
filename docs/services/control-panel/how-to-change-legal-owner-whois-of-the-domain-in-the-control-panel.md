## Issue: I don’t see the pencil icon to change WHOIS details

If you don’t see the pencil icon next to “Legal Owner (WHOIS)” title, you don’t have permissions to edit the details. Check if you’re the Owner of the domain or ask the Owner to change the details.

### Issue: I don’t see the WHOIS details

If you have DNS-only domain you won’t see WHOIS details. Changing WHOIS for the domain is applicable only for TLD domains. To be able to change WHOIS details you need to upgrade DNS-only to TLD.
