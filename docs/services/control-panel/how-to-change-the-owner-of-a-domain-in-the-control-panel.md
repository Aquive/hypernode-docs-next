# How to change the financial owner of the domain in the Control Panel

As well as [transferring ownership of the Hypernode](https://docs.hypernode.com/services/control-panel/how-to-transfer-ownership-of-a-hypernode-in-the-control-panel.html) you can now also change the domain's owner.

*Note that the new owner is required to have a valid payment method to accept the transfer, they have the option to do so at this step in case they do not have a valid payment method on their account.*

## Change the owner of the domain

To change the owner of the domain you need to follow these steps:

1. Log into the Control Panel.
1. Choose  **Domains** > Select a domain in which you want to change the owner and click the **Change the owner** link
1. Put an email of the new owner and optionally the message
1. Click the orange button **Change the owner**
1. The new owner receives a confirmation email and can then accept the request.

## “You cannot transfer with a Hypernode” notification

If you see the notification and cannot click the button, it means you have a Hypernode linked to this domain. First, you need to unlink a domain. To do so follow the steps below.

### Option 1

1. Press “unlink it” in the notification. It will redirect you to the page with the linked Hypernode.
1. In the list, check the circle next to the “Unlink” option and press Save
1. Follow the steps from point 1. Change the owner of the domain

### Option 2

1. Go back to the previous page - the domain dashboard
1. In the section **Linked Hypernode** press the button **Edit linked Hypernode**
1. In the list, check the circle next to the “Unlink” option and press **Save**
1. Follow the steps from point 1. Change the owner of the domain

## I don’t see the link to change the owner in domain dashboard

The option is visible only for the owner of the email that’s going to change. If it’s not your email and you want to change the owner, you need to ask the owner of the domain to do so.

## I don’t want to unlink a domain

If you want to transfer domain without unlinking it from the Hypernode, you can transfer it together with the Hypernode. To do this, [follow the steps for transferring Hypernode](https://docs.hypernode.com/services/control-panel/how-to-transfer-ownership-of-a-hypernode-in-the-control-panel.html).

## I want to cancel the request to change the owner

You can cancel the request as long as the new owner has not accept it. To cancel changing the owner:

1. Log in to the Control Panel
1. Choose Domains > Select a domain and click **Change the owner**
1. Press **Cancel request.**
